# DSA with C++ – Step-by-Step Learning by Vineet Kumar Yadav

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms repository using C++, built with a clean, organized, and beginner-friendly structure.  
This repo is designed to help students, interview aspirants, and developers improve their DSA skills progressively — starting from Brute Force, then moving to Better, and finally to the Optimal solution.

## What’s Inside?

- Well-commented code with logic explanation
- Covers multiple approaches: Brute → Better → Optimal
- Categorized by topic (Arrays, Math, Recursion, Linked List, etc.)
- Structured by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Each solution includes Time and Space Complexity
- Problem statements included in question.md

## How to Use This Repository

Step 1: Clone the repo

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Dsa_with_C++.git
    cd Dsa_with_C++

Step 2: Browse through topics

Each topic (like Basic_Math) has subfolders for difficulty level (like Medium), and every problem has its own folder.

Step 3: Run code

Each .cpp file contains one approach:
- brute.cpp – simple but less efficient
- better.cpp – improved logic
- optimal.cpp – most efficient solution with edge case handling

Use any C++ compiler or VS Code to run the files.

## Problem Approach System

Each problem follows this format:

| File         | Description                           |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| question.md  | Problem description & examples        |
| brute.cpp    | Basic approach with simple logic      |
| better.cpp   | Improved performance version          |
| optimal.cpp  | Most efficient version with overflow, edge cases handled |

## Example: Reverse Integer

Problem: Given a 32-bit signed integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing causes overflow, return 0.

Approaches:
- brute.cpp → String-based reverse
- better.cpp → Use long int for safety (but violates constraint)
- optimal.cpp → Pure 32-bit safe approach with checks
